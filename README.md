# Heart Disease Classification

In this assignment, I used the heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

**Analysis Steps**
- Applied Exploratory Data Analysis to the dataset
- Transformed the variables into the correct form
- Converted the target variable (`num`) to a binary variable by combining the values 1-4 into one category
- Constructed a correlation matrix
- Applied K-Means Clustering
- Applied PCA to reduce dimensionality
- Created a Logistic Regression model and calculated its AUC and accuracy
- Created a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and calculated its AUC and accuracy
- Applied feature selection using Lasso
